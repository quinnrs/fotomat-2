This is a codecademy exercise to repair broken code and setup a responsive website from a set of specs. I also want  to use this project to setup a use a new github repository from the command line.

After some non-productive effort, I decided to scrap the bad code and write my html and css files essentially from scratch, but using the same general id and class names.
